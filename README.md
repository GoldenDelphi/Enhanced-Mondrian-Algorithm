## About the Project:
The Mondrian algorithm is one of the most effective and quick algorithms created for applying this method. Solutions like data partitioning for multiple workers and running Mondrian on separate nodes, or implementing the algorithm in parallel runs, have made this algorithm scalable.

In this project, we use k-means clustering for data partitioning and then distribute clusters among workers to help make the Mondrian algorithm scalable while utilizing a modified and optimized clustering process to achieve better k-anonymity.

We optimize the clustering procedure by taking into account the overall distribution of quasi-identifier groups in a multidimensional space in order to better achieve k-anonymity through improved clustering. We make every effort to ensure minimized intra-cluster distances and maximized inter-cluster distances when using the local optimal clustering. As a result, the quality of anonymized data can be significantly raised.
